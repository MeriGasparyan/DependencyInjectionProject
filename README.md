## Comments
* I changed the method signature of save method of UserRepository interface, just for checking the functionality of Cacheable annotation, not actual logical modification
* PropertyAnnotationConfigurator class code logic is inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6wxPzXQvo) material provided to us. I made some minor change to handle blank application.properties file
